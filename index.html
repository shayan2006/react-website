 <h2>
     In react.js there are many codes from which we can create our website or style it
     here are some examples for the code to start from basic:
     we have two tags one is head and other one is body.
     HEAD is used to show what the page you are creating is about and body will contain the main content
     Now lets talk about the different codes lets first start with
     a href is used to create different pages in your website.H1 is heading1 we can have as many headings as we want we just have to increase the number 
     after the H.
